  |   A rhythmic music game unlike any other, the unique gameplay of        |
  |   Lanota is perfect for Nintendo Switch!                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Lanota offers a unique blend of dynamic music rhythm gameplay and     |
  |   storytelling, delivering a colorful narrative and enticing            |
  |   soundtrack in one package!                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You perform over 70 tracks on a 360 degree circular field - your      |
  |   goal is to hit notes all around the 'plate,' enabling you to both     |
  |   feel the beat and follow the musical flow. Tap, hold and slide to     |
  |   perform and achieve perfect combos and harmony!                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There are multiple ways to tackle each track - along with four        |
  |   difficulty settings you can choose to 'Tune' or 'Purify' songs.       |
  |   Purify ends your attempt if you miss too many notes, whereas Tune     |
  |   allows you to continue without that added pressure!                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In addition to dynamic circular play areas and varied beats to hit,   |
  |   Lanota offers a distinctive narrative. The world has lost sound and   |
  |   color, and the task falls to our two heroes - Fisica and Ritmo - to   |
  |   revive 'Notalium' and bring music back to the world. Complete songs   |
  |   to unlock new story segments and undertake this vital task!           |
